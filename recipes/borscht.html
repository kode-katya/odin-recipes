<h1>Borscht</h1>
<img src="../img/bor.jpg">

<p>Russian borscht is a traditional beet-based soup that has become a symbol of 
    Eastern European cuisine, <strong><em>particularly in Russia and Ukraine</em></strong>. This hearty 
    soup is renowned for its vibrant deep-red color, which comes from the beets, 
    the main ingredient. Borscht typically includes a variety of vegetables such as 
    cabbage, potatoes, carrots, and onions, along with beets. It can be made with or without meat, 
    with beef or pork often used for a richer flavor. The soup is slow-cooked, allowing the flavors 
    to meld together, resulting in a deeply savory dish with a slight sweetness from the beets.</p>

<p>Borscht is often served hot, topped with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of fresh dill, 
    which adds a cool, tangy contrast to the warm, earthy flavors of the soup. Itâ€™s commonly eaten as 
    a main course, especially during the colder months, thanks to its nourishing and filling nature. 
    However, borscht can also be enjoyed cold, making it a versatile dish for any season. The soup holds 
    cultural significance and is a staple in Russian homes, where each family may have its own unique 
    recipe passed down through generations.</p>

<h1>Okonomiyaki</h1>
<img src="../img/oko.jpg">
    <p>Okonomiyaki is a popular Japanese savory pancake that <strong>originated in Osaka</strong> and has become a beloved dish across Japan. The name "okonomiyaki" roughly translates to <strong><em>"grill what you like,"</em></strong> reflecting the dish's versatility and customizability. Its basic ingredients include a batter made from flour, 
    eggs, shredded cabbage, and water or dashi (Japanese soup stock). Additional ingredients can vary widely, often including pork, 
    seafood, or vegetables. The pancake is cooked on a hot griddle and topped with okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise, 
    bonito flakes, and sometimes seaweed. It's a flavorful and hearty dish enjoyed in homes and specialized restaurants alike.</p>

    <p>In addition to its delicious flavor, okonomiyaki is also known for its interactive dining 
    experience. Many restaurants allow diners to cook their own okonomiyaki at the table, 
     providing a communal and fun atmosphere. The batter is poured onto a hot iron griddle, 
    where customers can add their preferred toppings and watch it sizzle to perfection. 
    Different regions in Japan have their own variations of the dish, with Hiroshima-style 
    okonomiyaki being one of the most famous. Unlike the Osaka version, Hiroshima-style layers 
    the ingredients, often including noodles like yakisoba or udon. This regional diversity and
    the dish's adaptability make okonomiyaki a true representation of Japanese comfort food 
    culture.</p>

# odin-recipes

This is my first ever project for the Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to solidate some of the skills I learned from html. Some of the key features of this project include:

-being able to establish a Homepage
-using a variety of headers
-being able to emphasize different parts of a text using bold or italics
-being able to link other websites / pages from the same website
-including images & being able to resize them
-creating organize and unorganized lists
